# product-stock-mvc

This project was built to practice recent knowledge I acquired about ASP .NET MVC Core,
especially in parts related to views and error handling.

Product Stock would be a website developed to simplify the management and organization of your company's stock,
in our application you will have a control of all the providers and what are the products provided by them.

You will have a list of suppliers, with the option to see more details, where you can see the information of that supplier
(such as personal data and contact details) and also each of the products that he can provide, with image, price and quantity available in stock.
In addition to being able to edit, delete and create a new supplier.

We also have a list with only the products available in our stock, being able to edit, delete or create a new one,
in the product details section, in addition to information about the product, you are also able to see which provider it was provided by and carry out
the necessary updates in your stock, having total control of your business, in a simple and easy way.
